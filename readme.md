# Media Steganography Using Cryptographic Techniques

## **Project Overview**

This project explores enhancing data security during transmission by integrating cryptographic techniques with media steganography. It aims to create a secure data transmission method by concealing information within media files without the need for a web application, focusing on the direct application of these techniques.

## **Abstract**

The core of this project lies in its innovative approach to data security, combining the strengths of cryptography and steganography. Unlike traditional methods that rely solely on encryption or concealment, this project proposes a hybrid model. It leverages cryptographic algorithms to encrypt data, ensuring its confidentiality, and steganographic techniques to hide this encrypted data within media files such as images or audio. This dual-layered approach significantly enhances security by making the encrypted data less detectable and susceptible to interception. The project exemplifies this methodology through various algorithms, showcasing its potential to safeguard information against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats.

## **Introduction**

In the face of growing cyber threats, securing communication channels has become paramount. This project addresses this need by merging cryptographic encryption with steganographic concealment, providing an innovative and secure method for transmitting sensitive information.

## **Methodologies**

This study employs RSA and AES for robust data encryption and utilizes LSB (Least Significant Bit) for steganography, along with exploring enhanced LSB techniques to improve security further.

## **Conclusion**

The investigation concludes that integrating steganography with encryption offers a comprehensive and secure approach to protect data. While this project lays the groundwork, future exploration could include expanding the range of media formats supported and exploring the integration of advanced cryptographic algorithms.
